      <description>A June build update Decided that we should do monthly build updates as we march towards the end of the year. We&amp;rsquo;re hoping to reach lock up by then (walls, floor and roof complete) and 31st December is our D-day.
What we&amp;rsquo;ve done Erny bought a second hand table saw for $400 a few months back and it&amp;rsquo;s been an absolute workhorse. With it we&amp;rsquo;ve milled our wood down to size (70x45mm and 90x45mm) for our walls and have started cutting down the blackbutt for our window frames.</description>

      <description>Hello World ðŸ‘‹ My name is Lys and my partner Erny and I are building a tiny home made out of seconds, reclaimed and recycled materials. This is a small space on the interwebs to to document our progress and share our photos for anyone who would like to follow our journey! ðŸ˜„
Why build a tiny house? Erny and I have always been interested in living more sustainably and living small.</description>
