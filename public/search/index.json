We had been on the hunt for double glazed glass closer to home but it seems that Canberra - having cold winters - has great reclaimed glass options.\nTable Of Contents\rIntroducing Handyman Trading Post A side step antiquing So what\u0026rsquo;d you get? But why use double glazing?\nWeight is a huge issue in tiny house construction (we need to keep the building under 4.5 tonnes) and double glazed glass is notoriously heavy. This is fine for a traditional build but for tiny house construction builders often choose to install single paned glass. We chose double paned glass because firstly, Erny wanted this feature, but also because our windows will take a good percentage of our wall surface area. We\u0026rsquo;re also trying out a continuous band of insulation on top of insulation batting to reduce thermal bridging in light of Passive House design so it would be a pity to have insulated walls but have all our heat leak out of our windows. We\u0026rsquo;re also not planning on adding active heating mechanisms (e.g air-con) to the Miette if we have to so choosing double glazed windows seems like a good way to go for now.\nIntroducing Handyman Trading Post Handymans Trading Post specialises in used building materials and seems to be the only place that sells double glazed glass on the east coast. Erny found them on Facebook Marketplace and they were super friendly online. They recommended that we pop down in person to see their panes and even though they were in another state the trip was well worth it.\nThe Handyman Trading Post\nWindows everywhere!\nWhen we went in January, they had some great stock (which is what you get from over 41 years in business). They seem to have Australia\u0026rsquo;s collection cedar doors and window frames and some of the nicest stained glass windows too. You can find more about Handyman Trading Post here.\nCanberra has the best stock\nNote: they close at 1PM on Saturdays so if you are traveling from afar, factor this in! We arrived at 12:30 - just in time to pick up our glass.\nA side step antiquing There\u0026rsquo;s also a cute antique store named Down Memory Lane which is just opposite so we spent some time there checking out the wares. The stock seems so much cheaper than up North and the furniture was in top quality. Definitely recommend a looksee.\nCanberra has the best stock\nSo what\u0026rsquo;d you get? So after months of looking we have our double glazed glass for our custom windows!\nOur picture window is a generous 1400 x 1100mm and will be our main feature. It\u0026rsquo;s currently residing in Lys\u0026rsquo; office covered by a towel. Our kitchen window pane is a little larger than we anticipated coming in at (470x1200mm). We\u0026rsquo;ll have to manipulate our walls to fit this window into our design. We lucked out with our bathroom window as there was only a small selection of frosted glass options but we came away with a thin long window which we should be able to put frosted film on.\nFinally, we were super lucky to get two panes exactly the same dimensions for our loft windows (at 300x900mm)!\nCatch ya later, Lys \u0026amp; Erny\nArrive early if you\u0026rsquo;re traveling far\n","href":"/themiette/posts/a-quick-trip-to-canberra/","title":"A Quick Trip to Canberra"},{"content":"","href":"/themiette/tags/canberra/","title":"canberra"},{"content":"","href":"/themiette/posts/","title":"Posts"},{"content":"","href":"/themiette/tags/","title":"Tags"},{"content":"","href":"/themiette/tags/windows/","title":"windows"},{"content":"","href":"/themiette/tags/blackbutt/","title":"blackbutt"},{"content":"","href":"/themiette/tags/build_update/","title":"build_update"},{"content":"","href":"/themiette/tags/douglas_fir/","title":"douglas_fir"},{"content":"A June build update Decided that we should do monthly build updates as we march towards the end of the year. We\u0026rsquo;re hoping to reach lock up by then (walls, floor and roof complete) and 31st December is our D-day.\nTable Of Contents\rWhat we\u0026rsquo;ve done Challenges What\u0026rsquo;s next? What we\u0026rsquo;ve done Erny bought a second hand table saw for $400 a few months back and it\u0026rsquo;s been an absolute workhorse. With it we\u0026rsquo;ve milled our wood down to size (70x45mm) for our walls and have started cutting down the blackbutt for our window frames.\nWorking with a job site table (one that\u0026rsquo;s portable) saw has meant there have been a few tweaks that we\u0026rsquo;ve had to make. The first is that the vibrations and when one rips though a particularly long length of wood the fence is prone to shifting. Erny hacked a wood piece to clamp on to the table saw to minimise this.\nMilling douglas fir to size\nAnother is that the vibrations move the table saw forward on the table that we\u0026rsquo;re using. Once again clamps come to our rescue as we decided to clamp down two pieces of wood to the end of the table. These act as a stopper to stop the table saw shifting.\nCutting blackbutt to size\nSomething else that we\u0026rsquo;ve noticed is how good douglas fir smells. Apparently it smells like citrus but it just smells really fragrant. And as a soft wood it\u0026rsquo;s super light! Douglas fir is considered one of the most resilient softwoods in the commercial market and can handle really hard conditions. You\u0026rsquo;ll find it in older style houses or in large beams. Apparently, it was the go-to wood in the 19th century and was milled in all over Sydney. Now, apparently, Australia goes for treated pine for its lumber material as its quicker to grow and Douglas fir is less available. Our lumber comes from a timber mill that was closing down to make way for apartments and off cuts from a housing renovation.\nBlackbutt is our wood of choice to frame our windows with Erny having the bright idea to make the window frames himself. It\u0026rsquo;s a ridiculously heavy native hardwood that has a gorgeous grain and colour. We picked up the planks at an auction house to save them from getting mulched as they have quite a few cracks and burls in them (or as some people like to say - character). It also smells different to the Douglas fir when it gets sawn - because it\u0026rsquo;s a hardwood. Since Blackbutt is so dense it causes the blade to heat up due to increased friction. This burns the wood and brings out a more burnt smell.\nWood Density Notes Douglas Fir 550kg/m3 Softwood Blackbutt 900kg/m3 Hardwood Also, we\u0026rsquo;re following part of the Unified Construction Method by Fred Schultz, by creating ply connectors for our roof rafters and have measured 23 of these out. Lys had to hunt high and low for a protractor that hadn\u0026rsquo;t been touched since Year 6 Maths.\nChallenges We\u0026rsquo;ve had a string of pretty good weekends in June so can\u0026rsquo;t complain about the weather! ‚òÄÔ∏èüåßÔ∏è A thing we\u0026rsquo;re trying to tweak at the moment is finding fastest and most optimal way to set up our workspace since we\u0026rsquo;re working outside. Currently we\u0026rsquo;re putting out two fold out tables and using some spare agriculture pipe to manage particles.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s next? Erny\u0026rsquo;s flying out to the US for most of July and the forecast is looking pretty awful so it\u0026rsquo;s unlikely that we\u0026rsquo;ll be getting much done this month. We\u0026rsquo;ll probably be writing up a bit more content as well catching everyone up on what we\u0026rsquo;ve been up to over the last 6 months too!\nCatch ya later, Lys \u0026amp; Erny\n","href":"/themiette/posts/june-2022-build-update/","title":"June 2022 Build Update"},{"content":"","href":"/themiette/tags/tiny_house/","title":"tiny_house"},{"content":"Definition: miette [/mj…õt/] nom f√©minin\nA crumb, fragment or small amount.

Do you have any constraints? What does miette mean? So how\u0026rsquo;s it going? Why build a tiny house? Erny and I have always been interested in living more sustainably and living small. Then a pandemic hit and it seemed like a good idea to get started on making the dream a reality.\nDo you have any constraints? We\u0026rsquo;re trying to do everything (bar trailer, electrical and plumbing) ourselves.\nOther constraints include:\nBuying second hand or borrowing tools (from tool libraries and benevolent friends) Going for second, reclaimed and recycled materials first (thank you Facebook marketplace ‚ù§Ô∏è) Having limited construction knowledge (however we have some amazing friends who do!) Working full time jobs with no plans on quitting them We\u0026rsquo;re also following the building principles of Fred\u0026rsquo;s Tiny Houses and his Unified Construction Method and Passive Haus Design principles.\nWhat does miette mean? Miette is the french word for crumb or morsel. We chose it as we share a love of pastries, bread and all things that create tiny dust carbs but also because crumbs (like our budget) are small - like our tiny house! We also love the colour yellow - you\u0026rsquo;ll often see Erny running about in a yellow raincoat.\nOther names that we bounced around included:\nLe petit chou (the little cabbage) Wanda Inn The Blue Elephant Half Bark House Block House (after our favourite climbing gym) So how\u0026rsquo;s it going? It\u0026rsquo;s going very slooooooooooooooowly. We\u0026rsquo;ve bought the trailer and have now milled our wood but Covid, La Ni√±a and general life have really halted our progress.\nCatch ya later, Lys \u0026amp; Erny\nLys \u0026amp; Erny\n","href":"/themiette/posts/hi-im-miette/","title":"Hi I'm Miette"},{"content":"","href":"/themiette/authors/","title":"Authors"},{"content":"","href":"/themiette/categories/","title":"Categories"},{"content":"","href":"/themiette/search/","title":"Search"},{"content":"","href":"/themiette/series/","title":"Series"}]
