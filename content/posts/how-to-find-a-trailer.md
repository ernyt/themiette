### A Foundation

One of the biggest purchases we made for this build was the trailer. As the foundation of our house it was something that we didn't really want to make ourselves (there was a hard stop at learning how to weld). We also wanted the trailer to be road worthy so thought it would be best to leave this to the professionals. 

#### Researching
When you first start researching about tiny houses one definitely gets lured in with titles like _"She Built a Beautiful TINY HOUSE for only $12,384!"_ and _"Jay Shafer's Stunning $5,000 Tiny House"_ (these may or may not be real tiny house videos on YouTube). We're not saying that it isn't possible, but we quickly found out that a trailer made by a reputable trailer manufacturers in Australia would cost well over $5000. 

- rated up to 4.5 tonnes
