### A September build update

Hello Spring! Working almost every weekend, these last two months we've actually got some work done. 

{{< toc >}}

#### What we've done
- Selecting, measuring and cutting the roof rafters and purchasing flashing kits
- Stripping the cladding
- Finalising our window design and purchasing sealing - making our first windows :) 

#### Challenges


#### What's next?
Australia's Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) has officially confirmed that we are heading into yet another, our 3rd La Ni√±a coming into 2023 so honestly not feeling very hopeful. But slow progress is still progress so that is something.

Catch ya later,
Lys & Erny
