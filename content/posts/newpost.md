### Musings on Upcycling Materials

Early in 2022, Erny found a seller that was giving away a shed for free. We were in dire of a shed so we went and got it. The catch? We had to tear down the shed ourselves, pack it up and re-assemble. It took us 12 hours to dismantle, two van trips and one storm. We could have bought this $700

#### How do we value materials? 


Erny bought a second hand table saw for $400 a few months back and it's been an absolute workhorse. With it we've milled our wood down to size (70x45mm) for our walls and have started cutting down the blackbutt for our window frames. 

Catch ya later,
Lys & Erny
