### An Nov build update
Instead of finishing windows we went to a wedding, a berry farm and tried out for Asia-Oceania Ultimate Championships ü•è.

#### What we've done
So while writing this blog post, Lys discovers there's a frisbee emoji ü•è also known as the flying disc emoji - how random! Tiny house wise though - our journey continues working on our windows. We spend most of our weekends sanding the burn marks off the blackbutt panels to get ready for piecing. We have only one un-sanded window left which is so exciting! Unfortunately, it's also the biggest window so it will take some time. We decided put together the bathroom window (smallest) as a test run. This proved difficult as the pieces had bowed slightly and were not really sitting square. Erny decided that we needed to re-sand these pieces so they became more-square to give us the best hope of flush corners. This set us back a weekend as we worked overtime to re-sand the pieces. 

With the parts of the frame now square we had the arduous task of lining everything up to drill our pilot holes. With a contraption of too many clamps we raced against the sun to screw our window frames together which ended up with... a fail. A piece or clamp must have shifted in the process and when Erny screwed the pieces together we could tell that our window would not fit our glass. So, over the week Lys puttied up the holes with sawdust, glue and putty for another crack at it. This time we started earlier and took our time. This ended with a beautifully square(ish) window frame! 

We also test drove the [Osmo - UV Protection Oil](https://www.osmoaustralia.com.au/).It is lovely and pulls the colour of the blackbutt out so well. It does however make the putty quite orange, so we are currently tossing up if we should do a stain underlayer. 


#### Highlights
Lys doesn't want to jinks it but the weather has actually been really good in November. Fingers crossed for a good December! ü§û

#### Challenges
Not so much of a challenge but we're trying to enjoy life (and the good weather while we build). Congrats to Jo and Mandi :) 

Design wise, we hit a little snag whereby we are trying to work out how our awning hinges will stay weather tight. Our previous design did not account for hinge movement and so part of the hinges will be exposed to the elements. We need to go back to the drawing board to see if we can incorporate some sort fo protector for the hinge piece that will be exposed in our current design. 

#### What's next?
More windows and maybe some walls? In the mean time enjoy some pictures from Nov. 

Catch ya later,
Lys & Erny
